When competing in arena games in World of Warcraft, the game only tells you your rating, games played and win-loss ratio.

Unfortunately, it does not tell you how many points you will receive at the end of the week.

This allows you to take out the guess-work and view the information easily and for free so that you can plan your armor and weapon purchases ahead of time.
